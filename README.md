🧠 Data Struct Viz

A modern learning platform to visualize, practice, and master Data Structures & Algorithms.

📌 Overview

Data Struct Viz is an interactive learning platform designed to help students understand Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) through visualizations, quizzes, personalized progress tracking, and an integrated leaderboard.
It transforms complex concepts like trees, graphs, stacks, queues—even sorting algorithms—into easy-to-understand animated visuals.

This project was built as a personal educational tool, but with production-quality structure and clean UI/UX.

🚀 Features

✔ Interactive Visualizations – See how data structures work internally
✔ Step-by-Step Animations – Every operation is broken down visually
✔ Practice Quizzes – Test your understanding instantly
✔ Performance Analytics – Track progress across DS topics
✔ Recommendations Engine – Get personalized weak-topic suggestions
✔ Leaderboard – Friendly competition to stay motivated
✔ Clean, Modern UI – Built with Next.js & React

🛠️ Installation
