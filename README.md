🧠 Data Struct Viz

A modern learning platform to visualize, practice, and master Data Structures & Algorithms.

📌 Overview

Data Struct Viz is an interactive learning platform designed to help students understand Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) through visualizations, quizzes, personalized progress tracking, and an integrated leaderboard.
It transforms complex concepts like trees, graphs, stacks, queues—even sorting algorithms—into easy-to-understand animated visuals.

This project was built as a personal educational tool, but with production-quality structure and clean UI/UX.

🚀 Features

✔ Interactive Visualizations – See how data structures work internally
✔ Step-by-Step Animations – Every operation is broken down visually
✔ Practice Quizzes – Test your understanding instantly
✔ Performance Analytics – Track progress across DS topics
✔ Recommendations Engine – Get personalized weak-topic suggestions
✔ Leaderboard – Friendly competition to stay motivated
✔ Clean, Modern UI – Built with Next.js & React

🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aliirtaza7/data_struct_viz.git
cd data_struct_viz

# 2. Install all dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install additional libraries used in the project
npm install react-icons react-toastify

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev


Your project will be available at:
👉 http://localhost:3000

📦 Usage

Once the server is running:

Navigate the dashboard to explore available data structures

Click on any DS (Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

Use interactive buttons to Insert, Delete, Traverse, or Visualize processes

Take quizzes to reinforce concepts

Track your leaderboard ranking

View personalized suggestions based on your quiz performance

This platform is designed to help beginners AND intermediate-level students confidently master DSA.
